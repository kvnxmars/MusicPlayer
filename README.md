#Music API: The Heart of My Music Player App


üåü Overview
This project is the robust RESTful API serving as the core backend for my aspiring music player application (envision Spotify, but built by me!). It's designed to efficiently store and manage music-related data, laying the critical groundwork for a full-featured music streaming experience.

Currently, this API handles fundamental music entities, including song name, genre, artist name, and album name. It showcases my ability to design and implement structured data models and build reliable, testable API endpoints that are ready for seamless integration with a frontend application.

‚ú® Features
Core Music Data Management: Stores and retrieves essential song information (name, genre, artist, album).

RESTful Endpoints: Provides standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations via clear API routes.

Scalable Foundation: Built with future expansion in mind to support more complex features of a full music player.

Testable API: Designed for straightforward testing and integration.

üöÄ Technologies Used
Backend: C# (.NET Core)

Database: PostgreSQL (or specify if you used Oracle)

API Testing: Postman, Swagger UI (if implemented)

Version Control: Git, GitHub

Development Environment: Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code

üì¶ Getting Started
Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine.

Prerequisites
.NET SDK: Ensure you have the .NET SDK (e.g., .NET 6.0 or later) installed.

PostgreSQL: A running instance of a PostgreSQL database server.

Database Tool: A tool like pgAdmin, DBeaver, or command-line psql to manage your PostgreSQL database.

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone YOUR_MUSIC_API_GITHUB_REPO_URL
cd your-music-api-repo-name
(Remember to replace YOUR_MUSIC_API_GITHUB_REPO_URL with your actual repo link!)

Database Setup:

Create a new PostgreSQL database (e.g., music_api_db).

Update the connection string in appsettings.json (or appsettings.Development.json) to point to your PostgreSQL instance.

JSON

"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=music_api_db;Username=your_username;Password=your_password"
}
Run Entity Framework Core migrations to create the database schema:

Bash

dotnet ef database update
Restore Dependencies & Build:

Bash

dotnet restore
dotnet build
Run the API:

Bash

dotnet run
The API will typically run on https://localhost:70XX or http://localhost:50XX (check the console output for the exact URL).

üñ•Ô∏è API Endpoints & Usage
Once the API is running, you can interact with it using tools like Postman, Insomnia, or directly from your browser.

Here are examples of common endpoints:

GET all songs: GET /api/songs

GET a song by ID: GET /api/songs/{id}

CREATE a new song:
POST /api/songs
Body (JSON):

JSON

{
  "name": "Song Title",
  "genre": "Pop",
  "artistName": "Artist Name",
  "albumName": "Album Title"
}
UPDATE a song:
PUT /api/songs/{id}
Body (JSON): (Send the full updated object)

JSON

{
  "id": 1, // Must match the ID in the URL
  "name": "Updated Song Title",
  "genre": "Rock",
  "artistName": "New Artist",
  "albumName": "New Album"
}
DELETE a song: DELETE /api/songs/{id}

(Tip: If you've integrated Swagger UI, navigate to https://localhost:70XX/swagger to explore and test all available endpoints directly from your browser.)

üîÆ Future Plans
This API is the foundational step towards building a comprehensive music player application. Future enhancements may include:

User authentication and authorization.

Playlist management.

Integration with external music streaming services or audio file storage.

Search and filtering capabilities.
