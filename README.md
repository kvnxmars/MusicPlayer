#Music API: The Heart of My Music Player App


ðŸŒŸ Overview
This project is the robust RESTful API serving as the core backend for my aspiring music player application (envision Spotify, but built by me!). It's designed to efficiently store and manage music-related data, laying the critical groundwork for a full-featured music streaming experience.

Currently, this API handles fundamental music entities, including song name, genre, artist name, and album name. It showcases my ability to design and implement structured data models and build reliable, testable API endpoints that are ready for seamless integration with a frontend application.

âœ¨ Features
Core Music Data Management: Stores and retrieves essential song information (name, genre, artist, album).

RESTful Endpoints: Provides standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations via clear API routes.

Scalable Foundation: Built with future expansion in mind to support more complex features of a full music player.

Testable API: Designed for straightforward testing and integration.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
Backend: C# (.NET Core)

Database: PostgreSQL (or specify if you used Oracle)

API Testing: Postman, Swagger UI (if implemented)

Version Control: Git, GitHub

Development Environment: Visual Studio

Here are examples of common endpoints:

GET all songs: GET /api/songs

GET a song by ID: GET /api/songs/{id}

CREATE a new song:
POST /api/songs
Body (JSON):

JSON

{
  "name": "Song Title",
  "genre": "Pop",
  "artistName": "Artist Name",
  "albumName": "Album Title"
}
UPDATE a song:
PUT /api/songs/{id}
Body (JSON): (Send the full updated object)

JSON

{
  "id": 1, // Must match the ID in the URL
  "name": "Updated Song Title",
  "genre": "Rock",
  "artistName": "New Artist",
  "albumName": "New Album"
}
DELETE a song: DELETE /api/songs/{id}
